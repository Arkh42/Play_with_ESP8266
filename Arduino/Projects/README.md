# Projects targeting ESP8266 microcontroller

Projects presented in this repository target two main goals:
1. practicing ESP8266 coding
2. having fun with microcontrollers and electronics

Projects do not claim for being 100 % original nor even succesful.
The former shall be identified by *citing sources*.
The latter means that a project could lead to a dead-end.
It is not an issue *if and only if* the dead-end is explained (e.g., hardware limitation).
Failure is also a good way to learn. Especially when it is not for business ;)
