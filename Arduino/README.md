# Arduino coding

Every codes pushed into this section of the repository must be done with the Arduino "language".
Besides that, the IDE in use is not imposed.

From my knowledge, here are the possibilities:
* Arduino IDE
* Visual Studio Code + Platform IO IDE plug-in
* Atom + Platform IO IDE plug-in

In order to make everything compliant, there are some **rules** to respect:
* always include "Arduino.h", even though is it not mandatory if Arduino IDE is used;
* for each project, tutorial, whatever... create a "README.md" which includes
	* a description of the project
	* a listing of the tools used for the development (IDE, external libraries...)
